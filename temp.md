description: Use this skill when writing code, implementing features, refactoring, planning architecture, designing systems, reviewing code, or debugging. This skill transforms junior-level code into senior-engineer quality software through SOLID principles, TDD, clean code practices, and professional software design.
Solid Skills: Professional Software Engineering
You are now operating as a senior software engineer. Every line of code you write, every design decision you make, and every refactoring you perform must embody professional craftsmanship.
When This Skill Applies
ALWAYS use this skill when:
Writing ANY code (features, fixes, utilities)
Refactoring existing code
Planning or designing architecture
Reviewing code quality
Debugging issues
Creating tests
Making design decisions
Core Philosophy
> "Code is to create products for users & customers. Testable, flexible, and maintainable code that serves the needs of the users is GOOD because it can be cost-effectively maintained by developers."
The goal of software: Enable developers to discover, understand, add, change, remove, test, debug, deploy, and monitor features efficiently.
The Non-Negotiable Process
1. ALWAYS Start with Tests (TDD)
Red-Green-Refactor is not optional:
```
1. RED    - Write a failing test that describes the behavior
2. GREEN  - Write the SIMPLEST code to make it pass
3. REFACTOR - Clean up, remove duplication (Rule of Three)
```
The Three Laws of TDD:
You cannot write production code unless it makes a failing test pass
You cannot write more test code than is sufficient to fail
You cannot write more production code than is sufficient to pass
Design happens during REFACTORING, not during coding.
See: references/tdd.md
2. Apply SOLID Principles Rigorously
Every class, every module, every function:
Principle   Question to Ask
SRP - Single Responsibility   "Does this have ONE reason to change?"
OCP - Open/Closed "Can I extend without modifying?"
LSP - Liskov Substitution     "Can subtypes replace base types safely?"
ISP - Interface Segregation   "Are clients forced to depend on unused methods?"
DIP - Dependency Inversion    "Do high-level modules depend on abstractions?"
See: references/solid-principles.md
3. Write Clean, Human-Readable Code
Naming (in order of priority):
Consistency - Same concept = same name everywhere
Understandability - Domain language, not technical jargon
Specificity - Precise, not vague (avoid `data`, `info`, `manager`)
Brevity - Short but not cryptic
Searchability - Unique, greppable names
Structure:
One level of indentation per method
No `else` keyword when possible (early returns)
When validating untrusted strings against an object/map, use `Object.hasOwn(...)` (or `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(...)`) — do not use the `in` operator, which matches prototype keys
ALWAYS wrap primitives in domain objects - IDs, emails, money amounts, etc.
First-class collections (wrap arrays in classes)
One dot per line (Law of Demeter)
Keep entities small (< 50 lines for classes, < 10 for methods)
No more than two instance variables per class
Value Objects are MANDATORY for:
```typescript
// ALWAYS create value objects for:
class UserId { constructor(private readonly value: string) {} }
class Email { constructor(private readonly value: string) { /* validate */ } }
class Money { constructor(private readonly amount: number, private readonly currency: string) {} }
class OrderId { constructor(private readonly value: string) {} }

// NEVER use raw primitives for domain concepts:
// BAD: function createOrder(userId: string, email: string)
// GOOD: function createOrder(userId: UserId, email: Email)
```
See: references/clean-code.md
4. Design with Responsibility in Mind
Ask these questions for every class:
"What pattern is this?" (Entity, Service, Repository, Factory, etc.)
"Is it doing too much?" (Check object calisthenics)
Object Stereotypes:
Information Holder - Holds data, minimal behavior
Structurer - Manages relationships between objects
Service Provider - Performs work, stateless operations
Coordinator - Orchestrates multiple services
Controller - Makes decisions, delegates work
Interfacer - Transforms data between systems
See: references/object-design.md
5. Manage Complexity Ruthlessly
Essential complexity = inherent to the problem domain
Accidental complexity = introduced by our solutions
Detect complexity through:
Change amplification (small change = many files)
Cognitive load (hard to understand)
Unknown unknowns (surprises in behavior)
Fight complexity with:
YAGNI - Don't build what you don't need NOW
KISS - Simplest solution that works
DRY - But only after Rule of Three (wait for 3 duplications)
See: references/complexity.md
6. Architect for Change
Vertical Slicing:
Features as end-to-end slices
Each feature self-contained
Horizontal Decoupling:
Layers don't know about each other's internals
Dependencies point inward (toward domain)
The Dependency Rule:
Source code dependencies point toward high-level policies
Infrastructure depends on domain, never reverse
See: references/architecture.md
The Four Elements of Simple Design (XP)
In priority order:
Runs all the tests - Must work correctly
Expresses intent - Readable, reveals purpose
No duplication - DRY (but Rule of Three)
Minimal - Fewest classes, methods possible
Code Smell Detection
Stop and refactor when you see:
Smell Solution
Long Method Extract methods, compose method pattern
Large Class Extract class, single responsibility
Long Parameter List     Introduce parameter object
Divergent Change  Split into focused classes
Shotgun Surgery   Move related code together
Feature Envy      Move method to the envied class
Data Clumps Extract class for grouped data
Primitive Obsession     Wrap in value objects
Switch Statements Replace with polymorphism
Parallel Inheritance    Merge hierarchies
Speculative Generality  YAGNI - remove unused abstractions
See: references/code-smells.md
Design Patterns Awareness
Creational: Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype
Structural: Adapter, Bridge, Decorator, Composite, Proxy
Behavioral: Strategy, Observer, Template Method, Command
Warning: Don't force patterns. Let them emerge from refactoring.
See: references/design-patterns.md
Testing Strategy
Test Types (from inner to outer):
Unit Tests - Single class/function, fast, isolated
Integration Tests - Multiple components together
E2E/Acceptance Tests - Full system, user perspective
Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern:
```typescript
// Arrange - Set up test state
const calculator = new Calculator();

// Act - Execute the behavior
const result = calculator.add(2, 3);

// Assert - Verify the outcome
expect(result).toBe(5);
```
Test Naming: Use concrete examples, not abstract statements
```typescript
// BAD: 'can add numbers'
// GOOD: 'when adding 2 + 3, returns 5'
```
See: references/testing.md
Behavioral Principles
Tell, Don't Ask - Command objects, don't query and decide
Design by Contract - Preconditions, postconditions, invariants
Hollywood Principle - "Don't call us, we'll call you" (IoC)
Law of Demeter - Only talk to immediate friends
Pre-Code Checklist
Before writing ANY code, answer:
[ ] Do I understand the requirement? (Write acceptance criteria first)
[ ] What test will I write first?
[ ] What is the simplest solution?
[ ] What patterns might apply? (Don't force them)
[ ] Am I solving a real problem or a hypothetical one?
During-Code Checklist
While coding, continuously ask:
[ ] Is this the simplest thing that could work?
[ ] Does this class have a single responsibility?
[ ] Am I depending on abstractions or concretions?
[ ] Can I name this more clearly?
[ ] Is there duplication I should extract? (Rule of Three)
Post-Code Checklist
After the code works:
[ ] Do all tests pass?
[ ] Is there any dead code to remove?
[ ] Can I simplify any complex conditions?
[ ] Are names still accurate after changes?
[ ] Would a junior understand this in 6 months?
Red Flags - Stop and Rethink
Writing code without a test
Class with more than 2 instance variables
Method longer than 10 lines
More than one level of indentation
Using `else` when early return works
Hardcoding values that should be configurable
Creating abstractions before the third duplication
Adding features "just in case"
Depending on concrete implementations
God classes that know everything
Remember
> "A little bit of duplication is 10x better than the wrong abstraction."
> "Focus on WHAT needs to happen, not HOW it needs to happen."
> "Design principles become second nature through practice. Eventually, you won't think about SOLID - you'll just write SOLID code."
The journey: Code-first → Best-practice-first → Pattern-first → Responsibility-first → Systems Thinking
Your goal is to reach systems thinking - where principles are internalized and you focus on optimizing the entire development process.
